# Spatial Analysis of Spanish Banking Expansion 

To improve on David Ampudia's Economics research paper on the Banking Expansion of Spain, we emplyo spatial analysis and spatial regressions to provide more robust results. We do this by digitizing old Spanish maps to extract road network information as well as emplpy spatial regression on extracted spatial lag variables. The paper abstract is below and the full paper can be read in Ampudia_Leung_Spatial_TermPaper.pdf

### Abstract

This term paper exploits the staggered implementation of the Banking Expansion
Plans during the late Francoist regime as conditionally-exogenous shocks to local
economic outcomes. Using an original data set that combines rich municipality-level
data with the Bank of Spainâ€™s own information during the drafting of the Plans,
this quasi-experiment provides compelling reduced-form evidence of a positive and
lasting effect on local measures of growth and entrepreneurship associated to the
state-led expansion of the banking sector. Importantly, while the spatial distribu-
tion of commercial licenses and awarded municipalities in a Banking Expansion Plan
is geographically clustered, our results are robust to most specifications of Conley
spatial-robust standard errors. We also control for most spatial spillovers by building
kernelized spatial measures of banking presence and least cost paths using historical
road maps. Overall, our results reinforce the argument that policy-led expansion of
credit intermediaries can be an effective tool to promote growth and alleviate financ-
ing constraints.
